# frootpaint
v1.0 initial build with a lot of bugs and messy code, I started this with almost no knowledge of react and it's evident as I switched a bit between using react hooks and vanilla js

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.1 patch notes :

I ended up rewriting everything in vanilla js because things were getting a little messing with react!

- added a fully functional eraser tool (fixed from the initial commit)
- added support for mobile devices
- some small design improvements
